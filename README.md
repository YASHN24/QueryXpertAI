# QueryXpertAI
An AI model to read and analyze user-uploaded PDF documents, extracting text, generating vector embeddings, and using a supervised-fine-tuning Transformer-based Language Model to answer user queries with page references and contextual content.

Used--- 
Langchain: A framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for text splitting, chaining models, and creating retrieval-based systems. 
Langchain_community: An extension of the Langchain library that includes additional community-contributed components. PyMuPDF: A library for reading and manipulating PDF documents. It is used for extracting text from PDFs. Sentence_Transformers: A library for generating embeddings from text using pre-trained models. 
ChromaDB: A vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings. It allows efficient search and retrieval of text chunks based on their vector representations.
